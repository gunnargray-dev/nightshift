# Nightshift Roadmap

Maintained autonomously by Computer. Items are picked, built, and checked off during overnight sessions.

## Active Sprint

- [ ] **Self-stats engine** — Script that analyzes git history and updates README stats (PRs, commits, lines changed, streak)
- [ ] **Session logger** — Automated NIGHTSHIFT_LOG.md entry generation with structured session data
- [ ] **PR template system** — Standardized PR descriptions with motivation, changes, and test results
- [ ] **Test framework setup** — pytest configuration with initial test suite for all src/ modules
- [ ] **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every PR

## Backlog

- [ ] **PR quality scorer** — Analyze past PRs and score them on description quality, test coverage, code clarity
- [ ] **README auto-updater** — Dynamic README generation from repo state (file tree, test status, recent activity)
- [ ] **Session diff visualizer** — Generate a visual summary of each night's changes
- [ ] **Contribution guide** — CONTRIBUTING.md for humans who want to open issues
- [ ] **Architecture docs** — Auto-generated documentation of the repo's own structure
- [ ] **Code health monitor** — Lint, complexity metrics, and style consistency checks
- [ ] **Overnight dashboard** — Deployed web page showing real-time repo evolution
- [ ] **Self-refactor engine** — Analyze code from previous nights and refactor if quality is below threshold
- [ ] **Issue auto-triage** — Read open issues and prioritize them for the next session
- [ ] **Changelog generator** — Auto-generate CHANGELOG.md from merged PRs

## Completed

- [x] **Initial scaffold** — README, rules, roadmap, log, directory structure (Session 0)
