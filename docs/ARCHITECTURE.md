## Design Principles

1. **Self-awareness** — The system can inspect and analyze its own codebase
2. **Self-improvement** — Each session should make future sessions better
3. **Transparency** — Every decision is logged and every PR explains itself
4. **Testability** — All code is tested before being pushed
