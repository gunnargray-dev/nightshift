## Session 0 — February 27, 2026 (Setup)

**Operator:** Gunnar Gray (human)  
**Action:** Initial scaffold  
**Files created:** README.md, ROADMAP.md, NIGHTSHIFT_LOG.md, NIGHTSHIFT_RULES.md, src/, tests/, docs/  
**Notes:** The experiment begins. Computer takes over starting Night 1.

## Session 1 — February 27, 2026

**Operator:** Computer (autonomous)  

**Tasks completed:**

- ✅ **Self-stats engine** → [PR #1](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/1) — `src/stats.py`: analyzes git history to compute commits, lines changed, session count, and PR totals. Includes `RepoStats` dataclass with `readme_table()` renderer and `update_readme_stats()` for in-place README updates.
- ✅ **Session logger** → [PR #1](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/1) — `src/session_logger.py`: structured `SessionEntry` dataclass that renders to Markdown for NIGHTSHIFT_LOG.md and JSON for machine consumption. Handles append, dry_run, and footer replacement.
- ✅ **Test framework setup** → [PR #2](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/2) — 50 pytest tests covering all public functions in `src/stats.py` and `src/session_logger.py`. Includes both unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real git repos via `tmp_path`).
- ✅ **CI pipeline** → [PR #3](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/3) — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs pytest on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 on every push to `main` and every `nightshift/**` branch.
- ✅ **PR template system** → [PR #3](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/3) — `.github/pull_request_template.md` standardizes PR descriptions with What/Why/How/Test Results/Checklist sections.

**Pull requests:**

- [#1](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/1) — [nightshift] feat: self-stats engine + session logger (`nightshift/session-1-stats-engine`)
- [#2](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/2) — [nightshift] test: 50-test suite for stats engine + session logger (`nightshift/session-1-test-framework`)
- [#3](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/3) — [nightshift] ci: GitHub Actions pipeline + PR template (`nightshift/session-1-ci-pipeline`)

**Decisions & rationale:**

- Used `subprocess` + `_run_git()` helper over `gitpython` to keep zero runtime dependencies (gitpython is heavy and adds install friction)
- Shipped stats engine and session logger in a single PR (#1) since they're tightly coupled — the logger uses `RepoStats` and they share the same test branch
- Kept CI workflow minimal (no caching) for session 1; caching can be added in session 2 once the workflow is proven stable
- PR template's "Why" section explicitly calls out Twitter documentation as a forcing function for quality justifications
- All 50 tests mocked subprocess calls to keep suite fast (0.27s) while including one integration test per module that runs real git

**Stats snapshot:**

- Nights active: 1
- Total PRs: 3
- Total commits: 4 (initial + 3 feature branch commits)
- Lines changed: ~700 (src/stats.py: 217 lines, src/session_logger.py: 177 lines, tests: 577 lines, ci.yml: 37 lines)

**Notes:** First autonomous session. All 5 Active Sprint items shipped. The self-stats engine and session logger form the foundation for every future session — they are the system's ability to remember and reflect on its own work.

## Session 2 — February 27, 2026

**Operator:** Computer (autonomous)  

**Tasks completed:**

- ✅ **Code health monitor** → [PR #4](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/4) — `src/health.py`: AST-based static analyzer that scores every Python source file 0–100. Metrics: line counts, function/class counts, long-line violations (>88 chars), TODO/FIXME density, docstring coverage for public symbols. `FileHealth.health_score` uses a transparent penalty model; `HealthReport.to_markdown()` renders a per-file breakdown table.
- ✅ **Changelog generator** → [PR #5](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/5) — `src/changelog.py`: parses git history using a null-byte/record-separator protocol, extracts `[nightshift] <type>: <desc>` commits, groups by session and type, renders newest-first Markdown with canonical section labels (Features, Bug Fixes, CI / Infrastructure, etc.).
- ✅ **Coverage reporting** → [PR #6](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/6) — `src/coverage_tracker.py`: runs `pytest --cov=src` via subprocess, parses TOTAL and per-file lines, saves `CoverageSnapshot` objects to `docs/coverage_history.json`, renders Markdown trend table with color-coded badges (🟢/🟡/🔴) and ↑/↓ arrows. CI upgraded to install `pytest-cov` and run a dedicated coverage step.

**Pull requests:**

- [#4](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/4) — [nightshift] feat: code health monitor (`nightshift/session-2-code-health-monitor`)
- [#5](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/5) — [nightshift] feat: changelog generator (`nightshift/session-2-changelog-generator`)
- [#6](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/6) — [nightshift] feat: coverage reporting (`nightshift/session-2-coverage-reporting`)

**Decisions & rationale:**

- Chose `ast` module over `pylint`/`flake8` for health scoring to maintain zero external dependencies — `ast` is stdlib and parses 100% of valid Python without installation
- Used null-byte (`\x00`) + record-separator (`\x1e`) protocol for `git log` parsing to handle multi-line commit bodies without false positives from newline-delimited formats
- Coverage tracker uses subprocess instead of importing pytest internals because it needs to measure coverage of the `src/` package from outside, and importing pytest's coverage plugin mid-run corrupts instrumentation
- Kept `coverage_history.json` in `docs/` (not `src/`) because it's generated data, not source — keeping the separation clean
- Added 174 tests across 3 new test files (44 for health, 40 for changelog, 40 for coverage tracker); full suite runs in 0.25s

**Stats snapshot:**

- Nights active: 2
- Total PRs: 6
- Total commits: ~10
- Lines changed: ~1800 (src/health.py: 306 lines, src/changelog.py: 259 lines, src/coverage_tracker.py: 259 lines, tests: ~1300 lines)

**Notes:** Session 2 theme: quality infrastructure. The system now knows how healthy its own code is (`health.py`), can narrate what it built in each session (`changelog.py`), and can track whether test coverage is trending up or down (`coverage_tracker.py`). These three modules together form a self-assessment layer that Session 3 can use to drive self-refactoring decisions.

## Session 3 — February 28, 2026

**Operator:** Computer (autonomous)  

**Tasks completed:**

- ✅ **README auto-updater** → [PR #8](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/8) — `src/readme_updater.py`: generates a dynamic, always-accurate README.md from live repo state. `build_snapshot()` collects module docstrings via AST, test file counts, last-N commits, roadmap checkbox parse, and session log parse. `render_readme()` templates the snapshot into a full Markdown document. `update_readme()` writes README.md and returns a diff summary.
- ✅ **Session diff visualizer** → [PR #7](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/7) — `src/diff_visualizer.py`: generates rich Markdown summaries of each night's git changes. Unicode block-bar heatmap of per-file churn scaled to max diff size, commit timeline with timestamps and messages, test-delta section. `write_session_diff()` outputs to `session_diffs/session-N.md`.
- ✅ **PR quality scorer** → [PR #9](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/9) — `src/pr_scorer.py`: scores PRs across 5 dimensions (0–20 each, 100-point total): Description Quality, Test Coverage Signal, Code Clarity, Diff Scope, Session Metadata. Grades A+/A/B/C/D/F. `upsert_score()` persists to `pr_scores/scores.json`; `render_leaderboard()` generates sorted Markdown table.

**Pull requests:**

- [#7](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/7) — feat: session diff visualizer (`nightshift/session-3-diff-visualizer`)
- [#8](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/8) — feat: README auto-updater (`nightshift/session-3-readme-updater`)
- [#9](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/9) — feat: PR quality scorer (`nightshift/session-3-pr-scorer`)

**Decisions & rationale:**

- README updater uses AST for docstring extraction (not regex) so it handles multi-line docstrings and nested classes correctly with zero external dependencies
- Diff visualizer shells out to `git diff --stat` and `git log` rather than using a diff library — subprocess output is stable, human-readable, and avoids GitPython's installation overhead; binary files handled gracefully with explicit detection
- PR scorer uses a rubric-based approach (5 dimensions, transparent 0–20 scale per dimension) rather than ML classification so scores are deterministic, auditable, and self-improving — the agent knows exactly what to do to improve a score
- All three modules follow the established `build_X()` → `render_X()` → `write_X()` pipeline pattern used across the codebase
- 151 new tests added (48 + 56 + 47) for a suite total of 325; all tests mocked filesystem and subprocess calls, suite runs in 0.39s

**Stats snapshot:**

- Nights active: 3
- Total PRs: 9
- Total commits: ~13
- Lines changed: ~3000 (src/readme_updater.py: 395 lines, src/diff_visualizer.py: 397 lines, src/pr_scorer.py: 442 lines, tests: ~1500 new lines)

**Notes:** Session 3 theme: self-awareness and introspection. The system can now describe itself (README auto-updater), narrate what changed each night (diff visualizer), and grade the quality of its own pull requests (PR scorer). The Active Sprint is now empty — Session 4 will promote items from the Backlog.

## Session 4 — February 28, 2026

**Operator:** Computer (autonomous)  

**Tasks completed:**

- ✅ **CLI entry point** → [PR #10](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/10) — `src/cli.py`: unified `nightshift` command with 9 subcommands tying all 8 existing modules together. `nightshift run --session 4` executes the full end-of-session pipeline (health analysis → stats update → changelog → architecture doc → refactor report). Every subcommand supports `--json` for machine-readable output and `--repo PATH` for non-default roots. `cmd_run()` uses per-step error isolation — a failing module doesn't stop the rest of the pipeline.
- ✅ **Self-refactor engine** → [PR #11](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/11) — `src/refactor.py`: AST-based analysis across 5 defect categories: MISSING_DOCSTRING, LONG_LINE, TODO_DEBT, BARE_EXCEPT, DEAD_IMPORT. Each suggestion carries severity (high/medium/low) and fix_strategy (auto/manual/review). `RefactorEngine.apply_safe_fixes()` auto-inserts stub docstrings for short public functions. `RefactorReport.to_markdown()` renders a severity-sorted table with color-coded emoji badges. Integrated into `nightshift refactor` and `nightshift run`.
- ✅ **Architecture docs auto-generator** → [PR #12](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/12) — `src/arch_generator.py`: AST-walks `src/` to produce a rich, always-accurate `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Sections: directory tree, codebase stats, design principles, module inventory (per-file public API with signatures), internal dependency graph (which modules import each other), dataclass inventory. `save_architecture_doc()` writes the result; `nightshift arch --write` triggers it on demand.
- ✅ **Health trend visualization** → [PR #13](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/13) — `src/health_trend.py`: tracks health scores across sessions with Unicode sparklines (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█). `HealthTrendHistory` stores snapshots in `docs/health_history.json` using the same JSON-history pattern as `coverage_tracker.py`. `to_markdown()` renders session-over-session trend table with delta column. `to_per_file_markdown()` shows per-file score evolution. `record_session_health()` is a one-call end-of-session integration.

**Pull requests:**

- [#10](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/10) — [nightshift] feat: unified CLI entry point — nightshift health/stats/diff/changelog/run (`nightshift/session-4-cli-entry-point`)
- [#11](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/11) — [nightshift] feat: self-refactor engine — AST-based analysis across 5 defect categories (`nightshift/session-4-self-refactor-engine`)
- [#12](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/12) — [nightshift] feat: architecture docs auto-generator from AST analysis (`nightshift/session-4-arch-generator`)
- [#13](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/13) — [nightshift] feat: health trend visualization with Unicode sparklines (`nightshift/session-4-health-trend`)

**Decisions & rationale:**

- CLI uses lazy imports in each `cmd_*` function so newly-added modules don't break existing subcommands if they fail to import — `nightshift health` still works even if `arch_generator.py` isn't present
- Self-refactor engine uses AST-only analysis (no external linters) to maintain the zero-runtime-dependency invariant that has held since Session 1; `ast.walk()` is fast enough to scan all 12 source files in <20ms
- Architecture doc generator regenerates the full document on each call rather than diff-patching — regeneration is idempotent, auditable, and eliminates stale-section bugs that plague incremental approaches
- Health trend sparkline uses min-max normalization per render call (not global normalization) so the sparkline always spans the full character range for the visible data window
- Chose to promote 4 Backlog items (CLI, self-refactor, arch docs, health trend) rather than building the Overnight Dashboard — the dashboard requires an external hosting decision that a human should make; the other 4 items are pure in-repo improvements
- 144 new tests added (39 CLI + 35 refactor + 33 arch + 37 health_trend) for a suite total of **469 tests**; full suite runs in 0.64s

**Stats snapshot:**

- Nights active: 4
- Total PRs: 13
- Total commits: ~17
- Lines changed: ~4100 (src/cli.py: 472 lines, src/refactor.py: 387 lines, src/arch_generator.py: 408 lines, src/health_trend.py: 298 lines, tests: ~1400 new lines)

**Notes:** Session 4 theme: composability and self-improvement. The system now has a single command (`nightshift`) that orchestrates all its capabilities. For the first time, `nightshift run` can be executed at the end of any session to automatically update stats, generate docs, analyze code quality, and surface refactor targets — closing the autonomy loop. The test suite grew from 325 to 469 tests.
