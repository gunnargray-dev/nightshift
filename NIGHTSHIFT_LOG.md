# Nightshift Log

Append-only record of every autonomous development session.

## Session 0 — February 27, 2026 (Setup)

**Operator:** Gunnar Gray (human)  
**Action:** Initial scaffold  
**Files created:** README.md, ROADMAP.md, NIGHTSHIFT_LOG.md, NIGHTSHIFT_RULES.md, src/, tests/, docs/  
**Notes:** The experiment begins. Computer takes over starting Night 1.

## Session 1 — February 27, 2026

**Operator:** Computer (autonomous)  

**Tasks completed:**

- ✅ **Self-stats engine** → [PR #1](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/1) — `src/stats.py`: analyzes git history to compute commits, lines changed, session count, and PR totals. Includes `RepoStats` dataclass with `readme_table()` renderer and `update_readme_stats()` for in-place README updates.
- ✅ **Session logger** → [PR #1](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/1) — `src/session_logger.py`: structured `SessionEntry` dataclass that renders to Markdown for NIGHTSHIFT_LOG.md and JSON for machine consumption. Handles append, dry_run, and footer replacement.
- ✅ **Test framework setup** → [PR #2](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/2) — 50 pytest tests covering all public functions in `src/stats.py` and `src/session_logger.py`. Includes both unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real git repos via `tmp_path`).
- ✅ **CI pipeline** → [PR #3](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/3) — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs pytest on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 on every push to `main` and every `nightshift/**` branch.
- ✅ **PR template system** → [PR #3](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/3) — `.github/pull_request_template.md` standardizes PR descriptions with What/Why/How/Test Results/Checklist sections.

**Pull requests:**

- [#1](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/1) — [nightshift] feat: self-stats engine + session logger (`nightshift/session-1-stats-engine`)
- [#2](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/2) — [nightshift] test: 50-test suite for stats engine + session logger (`nightshift/session-1-test-framework`)
- [#3](https://github.com/gunnargray-dev/nightshift/pull/3) — [nightshift] ci: GitHub Actions pipeline + PR template (`nightshift/session-1-ci-pipeline`)

**Decisions & rationale:**

- Used `subprocess` + `_run_git()` helper over `gitpython` to keep zero runtime dependencies (gitpython is heavy and adds install friction)
- Shipped stats engine and session logger in a single PR (#1) since they're tightly coupled — the logger uses `RepoStats` and they share the same test branch
- Kept CI workflow minimal (no caching) for session 1; caching can be added in session 2 once the workflow is proven stable
- PR template's "Why" section explicitly calls out Twitter documentation as a forcing function for quality justifications
- All 50 tests mocked subprocess calls to keep suite fast (0.27s) while including one integration test per module that runs real git

**Stats snapshot:**

- Nights active: 1
- Total PRs: 3
- Total commits: 4 (initial + 3 feature branch commits)
- Lines changed: ~700 (src/stats.py: 217 lines, src/session_logger.py: 177 lines, tests: 577 lines, ci.yml: 37 lines)

**Notes:** First autonomous session. All 5 Active Sprint items shipped. The self-stats engine and session logger form the foundation for every future session — they are the system's ability to remember and reflect on its own work.
